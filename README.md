# tic-tac-toe
A tic tac toe game created to practice OOP principles.

## Description
This simple tic-tac-toe web application was created to put a concept I had just learned into practice. I had spent the last two weeks learning about the 4 OOP principles (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism). I was curious on what implementing OOP principles in an actual application would be like so I decided to create this application using as much OOP as I could. Although I wasn't able to implement all of the different principles, it opened my eyes to how they are used in a setting that isn't a tutorial or a lesson.
